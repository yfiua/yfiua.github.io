Fcitx occasionally occupies 100% CPU on Ubuntu when you use sogou-pinyin. To fix it without restarting the computer:

1. Restart `fcitx`
        
        $ fcitx -r

2. Disable `ibus-daemon`

   You will need to disable `ibus-daemon` if the above command fails to execute and shows something like *Start XIM error. Another XIM daemon named ibus is running?*. If you simply kill the process, it will respawn soon. Find the executable and rename it.
   
        $ sudo mv /usr/bin/ibus-daemon /usr/bin/ibus-daemon.bak

3. Uninstall `apport`
    
   After restarting `fcitx`, `apport` might complain. It is fair enough to get rid of the annoying `apport` pop-ups by just uninstalling it, since Canonical is never in short of bug tickets.

        $ sudo apt-get purge apport
