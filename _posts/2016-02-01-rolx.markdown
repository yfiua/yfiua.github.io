I have been studying the paper "[RolX: Structural Role Extraction & Mining in Large Graphs](http://briangallagher.net/pubs/henderson-etal-kdd2012.pdf)" for a while, and made a [presentation](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/en/news/role-classification-networks-based-transfer-learning). The paper describes an algorithm RolX, which can perform unsupervised role detection for nodes in networks based on structural features extracted. It also supports transductive transfer learning (across-network role classification), which I am mainly interested in.

# Unsupervised Role Detection
Some [analysis](http://lab41.github.io/blog/2014/12/18/rolx-discovering-individuals-roles-in-a-social-network/) by others, already demonstrates the unsupervised learning part. From my understanding, this part has three steps.

## Feature Extraction

## Feature Grouping

## Model Selection

# Transfer Learning

# Implementation
[Implementation](https://github.com/Lab41/Circulo/blob/master/circulo/algorithms/rolx.py) is also available (in Python), but has something missing obviously:

* Does not work for undirected networks
* Again, has only the unsupervised learning part

TBC
