My name is Jun Sun. This is my personal site, and it follows the philosophy of minimalism. I mainly put my little stuffs here, like:

* reviews/understanding/comments of academic papers/tech reports
* codes/programs/git repos
* random thoughts
* other interesting/boring stuffs

It is basically a place to help myself organize things, but discussions are all welcomed.

# Setup
Although it's easy to set up this little site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it did take me a while to set up [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), in order to allow comments. See details [here](https://github.com/yfiua/yfiua.github.io).
